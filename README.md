I am glad you find me, finally!
During the time when i was working on my final project, I found I had the below problems:
1. Lack of creativity - I found it difficult to think outside box.
2. Keep forgetting HTML attributes and CSS value and properties. 
The things I learned from the project are:
1. Utilizing libararies and frameworks such as Bootstrap to improve efficiency.
2. Learned how to arrange classes and IDs more efficiently
